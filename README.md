# Student-ID-Game-Test

This is a small number puzzle game with a unique twist! Unlike traditional number puzzles, the goal is to arrange a shuffled set of numbers to match my Student ID in order.

## Gameplay

1.  **Target Sequence:** The game creates a target sequence based on my Student ID. If your ID has more than 8 digits, the game will use the first 8 digits.
2.  **Shuffled Numbers:** The game initializes a board with the digits of the target sequence, but randomly shuffled.
3.   **Rearranging:** You must rearrange the shuffled numbers until they match the target sequence in the correct order.
4.   **Winning:** You win the game when the numbers on the game board are arranged in the precise order of the target sequence (derived from my Student ID).

## Example

My Student ID is 801284817.

1.  **Target Sequence:** The game will use the first 8 digits: 80128481.
2.  **Shuffled Numbers:** The game board might start with something like: 21818408.
3.  **Your Goal:** You need to rearrange the numbers to get 80128481.


## Features
